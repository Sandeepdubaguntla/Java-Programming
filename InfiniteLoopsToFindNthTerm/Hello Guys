Now , Lets Learn about the Infinite loops

An infinite loop is a sequence of instructions in a computer program that repeats indefinitely 
because it lacks a proper termination condition. 
This means the loop never ends unless an external force stops it, 
such as a user manually halting the program or the system running out of resources.
